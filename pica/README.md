# Function Executor Service

## What is Pica?
Pica is function executor framework that allows you to run serverless and stateless Java functions. Pica executes your code in response to events (event-driven).

## Is Pica good?
No. I am doing this project _for fun_ so lots of design and implementations are not optimal.

I am following an agile process, trying to start from a working prototype (a.k.a, minimal viable solution) that address a single use case, and iterating to support more use cases.
